## HistoryQuiz!

### DEMO: [HistoryQuiz!](https://historyquiz-dev3rn0.netlify.app/)

This project is my first dynamic React App. It features basic use of State and Effect hooks and fetching data from third party API.

I decided not to over-complicate things with components and props, as the basic logic and elements do not take more than a couple hundred lines of code.

The app is currently hosted on Netlify and I used Vite to create the local react app.
